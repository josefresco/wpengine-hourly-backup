## Quick Setup

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: For Reliable Hourly Backups on WP Engine**

**WP Engine Hosting requires additional setup for reliable hourly scheduling:**

1. **Add to your wp-config.php file:**
   ```php
   define( 'DISABLE_WP_CRON', true );
   ```

2. **Enable WP Engine Alternate Cron:**
   - Log into your WP Engine User Portal
   - Select your site environment
   - Navigate to **"Utilities"**
   - Toggle the **"Alternate Cron"** switch to ON

3. **Why This Is Required:**
   - Standard WordPress cron only runs on page visits
   - WP Engine's Alternate Cron runs every minute as a true server-side cron
   - This ensures your hourly backups execute reliably regardless of site traffic

- Click **"Save & Test Credentials"**

**Step 2: Install Configuration**  
- Click **"Auto-Detect & Configure Current Install"** (recommended)
- Or manually select your install from the list
- Confirm your WP Engine install details

**Step 3: Email & Schedule**
- Add your notification email address (required by WP Engine API)
- Choose your backup frequency (1-24 hours)
- Save your configuration

**Step 4: Complete & Enable**
- Review your configuration summary
- Click **"üöÄ Enable Automatic Backups"** to activate
- Optionally test with a manual backup first

**‚ú® Key Benefits:**
- Visual progress indicators show your setup status
- All forms remain editable after saving (modify settings anytime)
- Success checkmarks confirm each completed step
- Direct links to WP Engine portal for easy access
- Mobile-responsive design works on all devices

## Troubleshooting

### WP Engine Cron Issues (Most Important)

**Hourly Backups Not Running**
1. **Use the new debug tools (RECOMMENDED):**
   - **Admin Panel**: Go to **Tools > WP Engine Backups** ‚Üí **Debug & Testing** section
   - **WP-CLI**: Run `wp wpengine-backup debug` for comprehensive diagnostics
   
2. **Check if WP Engine Alternate Cron is enabled:**
   - WP Engine User Portal ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Alternate Cron (toggle ON)
   
3. **Verify wp-config.php has:**
   ```php
   define( 'DISABLE_WP_CRON', true );
   ```
   
4. **Test manually:**
   - Admin Panel: Click **"Test Backup Now"** or **"Trigger Cron Function"**  
   - WP-CLI: `wp wpengine-backup test` or `wp wpengine-backup trigger-cron`
   
5. **Monitor access logs for wp-cron.php requests:**
   - Look for regular requests every minute to wp-cron.php
   - Check for 200 (success) vs 502 (timeout) response codes

**Cron Timeouts (502 Errors)**
- WP Engine Alternate Cron has a 60-second timeout limit
- The plugin includes timeout protection (50-second limit)
- Check error logs for timeout messages

**Missed Backup Events**
- Standard wp-cron only runs on page visits (unreliable)
- WP Engine Alternate Cron runs every minute (reliable)
- Enable Alternate Cron to fix this issue

### Common Issues

**API Connection Failed**
- Verify your API credentials are correct
- Ensure API access is enabled in your WP Engine User Portal
- Check that your install ID is correct

**Backup Creation Failed**
- Ensure email notifications are configured
- Verify you have permission to create backups for the install
- Check for rate limiting (too many backup requests)

**Install Auto-Detection Failed**
- Ensure you're running on a WP Engine server
- Verify the plugin can detect WP Engine environment variables
- Try manual install selection instead

### Debug Information

The plugin includes comprehensive debugging tools:

#### Cron Diagnostics
- **Environment Detection**: Verifies WP Engine hosting and WordPress cron status
- **Schedule Verification**: Shows all registered custom intervals (every_1_hours through every_23_hours)
- **Active Cron Jobs**: Displays all WordPress cron jobs and WP Engine specific jobs
- **Next Backup Time**: Shows exact timestamp and countdown for next scheduled backup

#### Manual Testing Tools
- **Test Schedule Creation**: Manually test cron event scheduling with detailed results
- **Run Cron Diagnostics**: Comprehensive system analysis and troubleshooting
- **Test Backup Now**: Execute backup function manually for testing
- **Trigger Cron Function**: Manually run the scheduled backup function

#### API Debugging  
- **Connection Testing**: Verify API credentials and connectivity
- **Install Detection**: Test auto-detection functionality
- **Backup Listing**: Fetch and display recent backups from WP Engine

### Error Codes

| HTTP Code | Meaning | Solution |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| 400 | Bad Request | Check API request format |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Verify API credentials |
| 403 | Forbidden | Check backup permissions |
| 404 | Not Found | Verify install ID |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Wait before creating another backup |
| 500 | Server Error | Contact WP Engine support |

## üèóÔ∏è Development & Technical Documentation

### üìä **Database Schema**

The plugin creates a comprehensive logging table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE wp_wpengine_backup_logs (
    id mediumint(9) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    backup_type varchar(20) NOT NULL,         -- 'manual', 'scheduled'
    status varchar(20) NOT NULL,              -- 'pending', 'success', 'failed', 'timeout'
    message text,                             -- Detailed status message
    backup_id varchar(100),                   -- WP Engine backup ID
    created_at datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at datetime,                    -- Completion timestamp
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    KEY backup_type (backup_type),
    KEY status (status),
    KEY created_at (created_at)
);
```

### üîå **WordPress Hooks & Integration**

**Core Actions:**
- `wpengine_backup_cron_hook` - Main scheduled backup execution
- `wpengine_backup_created` - Successful backup completion (passes backup_id)
- `wpengine_backup_failed` - Backup failure (passes error details)
- `wpengine_backup_started` - Backup initiation (passes backup_type)

**Configuration Filters:**
- `wpengine_backup_api_timeout` - API timeout in seconds (default: 30)
- `wpengine_backup_log_retention` - Log retention count (default: 100)
- `wpengine_backup_cron_timeout` - Cron execution timeout (default: 50)
- `wpengine_backup_email_required` - Force email requirement (default: true)

### üîÑ **Custom WordPress Cron Schedules**

The plugin dynamically creates 23 custom cron intervals:
```php
// Automatically generated: every_1_hours through every_23_hours
'every_12_hours' => array(
    'interval' => 43200,  // 12 * HOUR_IN_SECONDS
    'display'  => 'Every 12 Hours'
)
```

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Implementation**
- **Nonce Verification**: All AJAX requests include `wp_create_nonce('wpengine_backup_nonce')`
- **Capability Checks**: `current_user_can('manage_options')` required for all functions
- **Input Sanitization**: `sanitize_text_field()`, `sanitize_email()` on all inputs
- **SQL Injection Protection**: WordPress `$wpdb->prepare()` for all queries
- **XSS Prevention**: `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()` on all output

### Contributing

2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Security

- API credentials are stored securely in WordPress options
- All AJAX requests include nonce verification
- User capability checks ensure only admins can manage backups
- Input sanitization prevents XSS and SQL injection
